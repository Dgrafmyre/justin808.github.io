WordPress seemed like a good blogging platform, but it just didn't feel right.
I spend all my day editing text files, and in the past year, I fell in love
with org-mode for all non-coding writing. If you don't know Org Mode, it's like
having Markdown mode on steroids. You can have a numbered list in Markdown, but
org-mode lets you re-order the list, and that's just the beginning. Editing
blog documents in the WordPress editor felt almost as bad as being told to use
MS Word. I found that ergonomics of org-mode, including all the goodness of
recent versions of [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]], including [[http://emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil][Evil]] (Vim emulation), just made organization
of creative thoughts so much more enjoyable.

So I bit the bullet this weekend, and dove into [[http://octopress.org/][Octopress]]. You're looking at the
results of this endeavor, including my first Octopress article, and the latest
on redoing what I just did, which is using Octopress with Org Mode authoring,
using LiveReload, and deployed at no charge on github.com. 

If you used to writing real web applications, rather than know the intricacies
of a giant monolithic blogging platform, then the [[http://octopress.org/docs/theme/template/][customization of Octopress]]
seems so much more straightforward.  

I like [[https://github.com/robdodson/robdodson.github.com/blob/source/source/_posts/2012-04-30-custom-domain-with-octopress-and-github-pages.markdown][Rob Dodson's summary]]:

> [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) is a blogging framework written by [Brandon Mathis](http://brandonmathis.com/)
([@imathis](https://twitter.com/#!/imathis)) which sits on top of [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). Jekyll is
a static site generator, meaning there's no database associated with your blog. Instead of writing everything in a
WSYWIG linked to MySQL (like Wordpress or Blogger) you produce text files using Markdown which are then converted to
static HTML. There are 3 huge benefits to this approach. First, writing in Markdown is awesome. Once you learn the
syntax it's incredibly fast and you don't have to spend time playing with a tiny little editor window just to
<s>add</s> *some* **style** to your posts. Second, writing in your favorite text editor is also awesome. I produce
everything in [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) and every day I discover new tricks to make the process
better. If you've ever had to write a blog post using one of those horrible little TinyMCE editors you will appreciate
this feature. And lastly, static HTML is *fast*.

There's a few really cool things about how I shared this quote:

of which I got the source from his
github repo for his octopress blog.

* Basic setup
1. [[%20http://robdodson.me/blog/2012/04/30/custom-domain-with-octopress-and-github-pages/][Rob Dodson on Octopress]]: Start off with these instructions from this posting
   on April 30th, 2012. There are a few differences worth noting:
   1. You may wish to change the .rvmrc to a .ruby-version file
   2. Github recommends your deployment repository be named =yourname.github.io=,
      not =yourname.github.com=.
   3. After you run =rake setup_github_pages= and before running =rake
      generate=, you should run =rake install=. If you forget, there's a clear
      message indicating this omission.
2. Customize =octopress/_config.yml=. The yaml file contains descriptions.
3. Update the DNS to use your custom domain if you wish: [[https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages][Github directions on
   setting up a custom domain]]
4. At this point, you can either create a post or a page:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  rake new_post["my post name"]
  #+END_SRC
 
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  rake new_page["my page name"]
  #+END_SRC

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  # same as generate and deploy
  rake gen_deploy 
  #+END_SRC
 
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  # Watch the site and regenerate when it changes
  rake watch 
  #+END_SRC
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  # preview the site in a web browser
  rake preview
  #+END_SRC
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  # See all the available rake options
  rake -T
  #+END_SRC

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  # Save changes to source branch
  git add .
  git commit -m "save changes to source"
  git push origin source
  #+END_SRC

* POW
Pow allows you to point your browser to [[http://octopress.dev]] to see your
Octopress website. Scroll to the bottom of this page for details on [[http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/][POW]]. The
alternative to running POW is to run.
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  rake preview
  #+END_SRC

* LiveReload
LiveReload is a browser extension for Chrome that will automatically refresh
the browser after you publish your file. You don't need to buy the paid
product. I use the [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl%3Den][Chrome browser extension]]. You can use this with or without
POW.
+ [[http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86242-how-do-i-install-and-use-the-browser-extensions-][Install the browser extension]] for your type of browser.
+ Add these two entries to your =Gemfile=, in the :development group:
   #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
   gem 'guard'
   gem 'guard-livereload'
   #+END_SRC
   
+ Create a file called =Guardfile= containing something like:
   #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
     guard 'livereload' do
       watch(%r{public/generated})
       watch(%r{public/.+\.(css|js|html)})
     end
   #+END_SRC
   
+ Start 2 shell tabs running these commands: =rake generate && rake watch=
   and =guard= 
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     > rake generate && rake watch
   #+END_SRC
   This screen shot shows =watch= updating the deployment files.
   [[file:2013-04-27-octopress-setup-with-github-and-org-mode/rake-generate-watch.png]]
   start guard LiveReload
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     > guard
   #+END_SRC
   This screen grab shows guard detecting the browser and telling the
   browser to update.
   [[file:2013-04-27-octopress-setup-with-github-and-org-mode/guard-console.png]]

It's really worth the effort to get LiveReload working with Octopress.

It's worth noting that if you're running any other instance of guard-
LiveReload, then one of these two copies will win and one won't work. If you
run a rails server this way, then this can bite you. It took me a bit of time
to figure out why guard wasn't working.
  
* Org-mode Integration
[[http://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]] offers quite a bit more than plain markdown. It's quite the *hacker's
delight* for note taking and authoring of blog articles. Down below I list a
few reasons why org-mode.

1. Follow the instructions here: [[http://blog.paphus.com/blog/2012/08/01/introducing-octopress-blogging-for-org-mode/][Introducing Octopress Blogging for Org-Mode]]
2. At the time of this article, April 27, there's a bug with the latest
   org-mode. [[https://github.com/craftkiller/orgmode-octopress/issues/3][I posted a workaround.]] By the time you read this, you probably
   won't need that tip.
3. Images work fine. My strategy for org-mode is to create a separate
   subdirectory for each org-mode document for images. That keeps the images
   attached to the original document. The above instructions work fine at
   publishing images.


* Directory Structure of Octopress and the master and source Git Branches
I originally was quite confused by the concept of using two separate git
branches to make up what gets deployed on the live website versus the git
repository of my articles. Plus, there's the issue of Octopress git repository
that you clone when starting out. Eventually, I figured out that the two branches
simply contain different files, with one containing the original Octopress
files. Here's a few screen grabs that might clarify the situation for you.

The octopress/.gitignore file contains the following, which essentially keeps
the keeps the =rake generate= files out of the source branch.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
.bundle
.DS_Store
.sass-cache
.gist-cache
.pygments-cache
_deploy
public
sass.old
source.old
source/_stash
source/stylesheets/screen.css
vendor
node_modules
#+END_SRC

The =octopress/public= directory corresponds to what you'll find on the github
site for your deployment (master branch).
[[file:2013-04-27-octopress-setup-with-github-and-org-mode/public-dir-corresponds-master-branch.png]]

Here's the github master branch right after creation. Note the correspondence
with =public=. This is what gets deployed as your blog.
[[file:2013-04-27-octopress-setup-with-github-and-org-mode/github-master-branch.png]]


Here's the github source branch. This contains the octopress environment, as
well as your customizations and blog posts.
[[file:2013-04-27-octopress-setup-with-github-and-org-mode/github-source-branch.png]]


* Why org-mode for blog publishing?
Here's a few org-mode features I love (Some are Emacs ones):
1. All headers and list items can be reordered with minimal keystrokes (think
   super powerful outliner).
2. Numbered lists
3. Editable tables in text editor, with movable columns, movable rows
4. Ergonomics of insertion of URLs and images.
5. Includes the basics of markdown, such as source code blocks.
