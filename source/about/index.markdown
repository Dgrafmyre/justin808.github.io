Justin has been passionately writing software since 1985, focusing on Java since
1996 at several startups and with Ruby on Rails the past couple of years. This
blog is created using Octopress, as described <a href="http:/blog/2013/04/27/octopress-setup-with-github-and-org-mode/index.html">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Justin Gordon pioneered the use of Test Driven
Development, JUnit, and other Agile development techniques. Justin founded the
open source project, the Dependent Object Framework, which vastly simplifies and
accelerates JUnit testing with persistent dependencies. Justin graduated in 1991
with an AB magna cum laude in applied mathematics from Harvard and received an
MBA from UC Berkeley in 2001.

Besides writing great software, Justin enjoys the ocean sports found in Maui,
and has done quite a bit of home improvement, having designed and built the
Sugar Ranch, a B&amp;B (pending application) where he lives with his family. You can
