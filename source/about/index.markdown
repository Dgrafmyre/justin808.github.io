Justin has been passionately writing software since 1985, focusing on Java since
1996 at several startups and with Ruby on Rails the past couple of years. This
blog is created using Octopress, as described <a href="http:/blog/2013/04/27/octopress-setup-with-github-and-org-mode/index.html">here</a>.

developer who doesn't use Vim or Emacs.", the "Hipster Hacker" on Twitter.

  <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/infosphere/mdm/collaborative.html">InfoSphere MDM Collaborative Edition</a>. This involved tons of TDD along with
  tons of experience optimizing Java code in Yourkit, and inventing clever time
  and space solutions, including binary data stores and distributed caching.
</li>
<li>Love programming in Ruby on Rails and the whole wonderful ecosystem of Heroku,
  Amazon EC2, jQuery, coffeescript, haml, sass, etc.
</li>
<li>Close connections to the Jetbrains team and expert with their tools: IntelliJ and RubyMine.

  Harvard and received an MBA from UC Berkeley in 2001.
