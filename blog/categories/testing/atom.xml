<h2 id="sec-1">Motivation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Today I migrated a medium size test suite from <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit">capybara-webkit</a> to <a href="https://github.com/jonleighton/poltergeist">Poltergeist</a>
with <a href="http://phantomjs.org/index.html">PhantomJS</a>. I had two main motivations for switching:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>PhantomJS is more sensitive to avoiding false positives. For example, in the
past, one could click on non-visible DOM elements with capybara-webkit.
While this may not currently be true with the latest Capybara, I've had good
luck with PhantomJS in the past.
</li>
<li>Speed. When I last checked, PhantomJS was faster. Speed is critical for slow
feature tests.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Here's one reason that Poltergeist is more accurate and <a href="https://github.com/jonleighton/poltergeist">sensitive to failure</a>: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
When Poltergeist clicks on an element, rather than generating a DOM click event,
it actually generates a "proper" click. This is much closer to what happens when
a real user clicks on the page - but it means that Poltergeist must scroll the
page to where the element is, and work out the correct co-ordinates to click. If
the element is covered up by another element, the click will fail (this is a
good thing - because your user won't be able to click a covered up element
either).
</p>

<h2 id="sec-2">Tips for Migrating</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
</div><div id="outline-container-sec-2-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-1">Upgrade Gems First</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
At first, I lost time due to timing issues where I was clicking on elements of a
hidden dialog that was not finished showing. Capybara-webkit was not bothered by
the fact that the dialog was actually hidden and being loaded. PhantomJS bombed
out. However, after I worked around the issue, I realized that my gems were
outdated. Since you're going to be fixing a bunch of tests anyway, it makes
sense to get on the latest versions of the testing gems. The gems you want to
upgrade are: rspec, rspec-rails, Capybara, and poltergeist. 
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2">Visible Option</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
After upgrading the gems, my workarounds were no longer necessary. However, the
change from Capybara 2.0 to 2.1 had a big change in the way that it handles
finding dom elements that are <b>not visible</b>. Previously, Capybara would not care
if the dom element was hidden. For my tests, this resulted in breaking any tests
that queried any non-visible DOM elements, such as scripts, meta tags, and
links.
</p>

<p>
The key thing to be aware of is that you might get this obscure error message,
and the fix is to add the <code>visible: false</code> optional parameter so that Capybara
is not filtering by <code>visible: true</code>. The <code>visible</code> parameter is available to
most finder methods in Capybara.
</p>

<p>
The obscure error you might see is something like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
#=&gt; Capybara::ExpectationNotMet Exception: expected to find xpath "//title" with text "Title Text." but there were no matches. Also found "", which matched the selector but not all filters.
</pre>

<p>
The reason is the title element is not visible, and "visible" is the "not all
filters" part of the error message.
</p>

<h3 id="sec-2-3">Debugging Capybara Tests</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
The main reasons that previously passing feature tests will fail when migrating
to Poltergeist is due to timing and visibility. The two main techniques for
debugging Capybara tests are:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Using screen shots (<code>render_page</code> below)
</li>
<li>Using HTML dumps (=page! below)
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Keep in mind that these methods will not wait for elements to load. Thus, you
should either have a Capybara statement that will wait for some DOM element to
load or you might want to put in a <code>sleep 10</code> to sleep for 10 seconds before
capturing the screen shot or dumping the HTML.
</p>

<p>
If you use the helper methods specified below, and you should be able to work
through why Poltergeist is not doing what you think it should be doing. So far,
I haven't yet run into a case where I have not found out that it's been my fault
rather than a bug in Poltergeist that's caused a failure due to the migration.
In many cases, you'll be somewhat pleasantly surprised that you'll be fixing a
false positive.

<h3 id="sec-2-4">Capybara's Wait Strategy</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
Be sure to carefully read the <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara">Capybara documentation</a>, especially the part
titled "Asynchronous JavaScript". That section explains how Capybara cleverly
will wait until the page or ajax call finished so that the element expected
appears. There's a configurable timeout (<code>Capybara.default_wait_time</code>) for
changing the default wait time before a test bombs out.

<h3 id="sec-2-5">Xpath Tip</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-5">
<p>
Be sure to understand the difference between <code>//something</code> and <code>.//something</code>.
The later can be used inside a <code>within</code> block. The former will find the tag
anywhere on the page, even when used inside of a <code>within</code> block!

Here's the setup and a couple utility methods that I use. Put these in a file in your helpers
directory, such spec/helpers/capybara.rb.
